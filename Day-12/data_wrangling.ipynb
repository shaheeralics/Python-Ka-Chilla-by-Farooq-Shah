    "#   data    wrangling\n",
    "    This process involves 'cleaning', 'structuring', and enriching the data to make it more accessible and valuable for 'decision-making'. Data wrangling is essential because raw data is often messy, incomplete, and unstructured, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights without significant preprocessing."
